            <p>I think I speak for a majority of Indians when I say this, Indians love Indian-Chinese food. From spring rolls, to Chowmein, to all things Szechwan, the cuisine has been an Indian favourite for ages. Of course, there’s been one constant preference for us all when it comes to Indian-Chinese – gravy with a thousand flavours making a chaos around perfectly fried chicken pieces, usually enjoyed with a neat helping of fried rice at the side.
